# Basic Blockchain Implemented in Rust

The intent was to learn more about how a blockchain works (the basics of it of course) and Rust, that is also in my study list. Very challenging project, mainly because it was written Rust :D

## Run locally

Basically the same as any `rust` project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/datsfilipe/basic-blockchain-in-rust.git && cd basic-blockchain-in-rust
$ cargo install --path . && cargo run
```
